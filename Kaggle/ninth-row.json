Acadian flag <P> The Acadians ( French : Acadiens ) are the descendants of the French settlers , and sometimes the Indigenous peoples , of parts of Acadia ( French : Acadie ) in the northeastern region of North America comprising what is now the Canadian Maritime Provinces of New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , and Prince Edward Island , Gaspé , in Quebec , and to the Kennebec River in southern Maine . </P> <P> The history of the Acadians was significantly influenced by the six colonial wars that took place in Acadia during the 17th and 18th century ( see the four French and Indian Wars , Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) . Eventually , the last of the colonial wars -- the French and Indian War -- resulted in the British Expulsion of the Acadians from the region . After the war , many Acadians came out of hiding or returned to Acadia from the British Colonies . Others remained in France and some migrated from there to Louisiana , where they became known as Cajuns , a corruption of the word Acadiens or Acadians . The nineteenth century saw the beginning of the Acadian Renaissance and the publication of Evangeline , which helped galvanize Acadian identity . In the last century Acadians have made achievements in the areas of equal language and cultural rights as a minority group in the Maritime provinces of Canada . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 As French colonials <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Port Royal Habitation ( 1604 - 1613 ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 Arrival of the first European families </Li> <Li> 1.3 Civil war </Li> <Li> 1.4 English colony ( 1654 -- 1667 ) </Li> <Li> 1.5 Post Treaty of Breda </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Colonial Wars <Ul> <Li> 2.1 French and Indian War <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 Re-establishing in Nova Scotia </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Nineteenth century <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Acadian renaissance </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Twentieth century <Ul> <Li> 4.1 The Quiet Revolution </Li> <Li> 4.2 Antonine Maillet </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Twenty - first century <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Acadian Remembrance Day </Li> <Li> 5.2 Acadian World Congress </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> As French colonials ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Port Royal Habitation ( 1604 - 1613 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Habitation at Port - Royal Portrait of Captain Samuel Argall <P> Pierre Dugua , Sieur de Monts built the Habitation at Port - Royal in 1605 as a replacement for his initial attempt at colonizing Saint Croix Island ( present day Maine ) . The trading monopoly of de Monts was cancelled in 1607 , and most of the French settlers returned to France , although some remained with the natives . Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint - Just led a second expedition to Port Royal in 1610 . </P> <H3> Arrival of the first European families ( edit ) </H3> <P> The survival of the Acadian settlements was based on successful cooperation with the Indigenous peoples of the region . In the early years of Acadian settlement , this included a small number of recorded marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women . Some records have survived showing marriages between Acadian settlers and Indigenous women in formal Roman Catholic rites , for example , the marriage of Charles La Tour to a Mi'kmaw woman in 1626 . There were also reported instances of Acadian settlers marrying Indigenous spouses according to Mi'kmaq rites , and subsequently living in Mi'kmaq communities . Many settlers also brought French wives with them to Acadia , such as La Tour 's second wife , Françoise - Marie Jacquelin , who joined him in Acadia in 1640 . </P> <P> Governor Isaac de Razilly 's administration at LaHave , Nova Scotia , prepared the ground for the arrival of the first recorded migrant families on board the Saint Jehan , which left La Rochelle on 1 April 1636 . There were a number of sailings from the French Atlantic Coast to Acadia between 1632 and 1636 , but this is the only one for which a detailed passenger list has survived . Nicolas Denys , who was stationed across the LaHave River at Port Rossingol ( Liverpool Bay ) , acted as agent for the Saint Jehan . After a 35 - day crossing of the Atlantic , the Saint Jehan arrived on 6 May 1636 at LaHave , Nova Scotia . There were seventy - eight passengers and eighteen crew members . With this ship , Acadia began a slow shift from being primarily a matter of explorers and traders , of men , to a colony of permanent settlers , including women and children . While the presence of European women is a signal that settlement was seriously contemplated , there were yet so few of them in this group of migrants that they did not immediately affect the status of Acadia as basically a colony of European transients . By the end of the year , the migrants were moved from LaHave and re-established at Port Royal . At Port Royal in 1636 , Pierre Martin and Catherine Vigneau , who had arrived on the Saint Jehan , were the first European parents to have a child in Acadia . The first - born child was Mathieu Martin . In part because of this distinction , Mathieu Martin later became the Seigneury of Cobequid ( 1699 ) . </P> <P> Kennedy ( 2014 ) argues that the emigrants from the Vienne region of France carried to Acadia their customs and social structure . They were frontier people , who dispersed their settlements based on kinship . They optimized use of farmland and emphasized trading for a profit . They were hierarchical and politically active . The French and the Acadian villages were similar in terms of prosperity , egalitarianism , and independent - mindedness . Kennedy says the emergence of a distinct Acadian identity emerged from the gradual adaptation of traditional French methods , institutions , and ideas to the North American environmental and political situations . </P> <H3> Civil War ( edit ) </H3> Siege of St. John ( 1645 ) - d'Aulnay defeats La Tour in Acadia Main article : Acadian Civil War <P> With the death of Isaac de Razilly , Acadia was plunged into what some historians have described as a civil war ( 1640 -- 1645 ) . Acadia had two legitimate Lieutenant Governors . The war was between Port Royal , where Governor Charles de Menou d'Aulnay de Charnisay was stationed , and present - day Saint John , New Brunswick , where Governor Charles de Saint - Étienne de la Tour was stationed . </P> <P> In the war , there were four major battles . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay at Port Royal in 1640 . In response to the attack , D'Aulnay sailed out of Port Royal to establish a five - month blockade of La Tour 's fort at Saint John , which La Tour eventually defeated ( 1643 ) . La Tour attacked d'Aulnay again at Port Royal in 1643 . D'Aulnay and Port Royal ultimately won the war against La Tour with the 1645 siege of Saint John . After d'Aulnay died ( 1650 ) , La Tour re-established himself in Acadia . </P> <H3> English colony ( 1654 -- 1667 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1654 , war between France and England broke out . Led by Major Robert Sedgwick , a flotilla from Boston , under orders from Cromwell , arrived in Acadia to chase the French out . The flotilla seized La Tour 's fort , then Port - Royal . La Tour , nevertheless , managed to find himself in England , where , with the support of John Kirke , succeeded in receiving from Cromwell a part of Acadia , along with Sir Thomas Temple . La Tour returned to Cap - de-Sable where he remained until his death in 1666 at the age of 70 . </P> <P> During the English occupation of Acadia , Jean - Baptiste Colbert , Louis XIV 's minister , forbade the Acadians from returning to France . As a result of the English occupation , no new French families settled in Acadia between 1654 and 1670 . </P> <H3> Post Treaty of Breda ( edit ) </H3> Marker commemorating the Dutch conquest of Acadia ( 1674 ) , which they renamed New Holland . This is the spot where Jurriaen Aernoutsz buried a bottle at the capital of Acadia , Fort Pentagouet , Castine , Maine . <P> The Treaty of Breda , signed 31 July 1667 , returned Acadia to France . A year later , Marillon du Bourg arrived to take possession of the territory for France . The son of LeBorgne , Alexandre LeBorgne , was named provisionary governor and lieutenant - general of Acadia . He married Marie Motin - La Tour , the eldest child of the marriage between La Tour and d'Aulnay's widow . </P> <P> In 1670 , the new governor of Acadia , the chevalier Hubert d'Andigny , chevalier de Grandfontaine , was responsible for the first census undertaken in Acadia . The results did not include those Acadians living with local First Nations . It revealed that there were approximately sixty Acadian families with approximately 300 inhabitants in total . These inhabitants were predominantly engaged in aboiteau farming along the shores of the present day Bay of Fundy . No serious attempt was made to increase the population of Acadia . </P> <P> In the spring of 1671 , more than fifty colonists left La Rochelle aboard the l'Oranger . Others arrived from Canada ( New France ) or were retired soldiers . During this time , a number of colonists married with the local First Nations . Some of the first to marry were Charles de Saint - Étienne de La Tour , Martin , Pierré Lejeune -- Briard , Jehan Lambert , Petitpas and Guidry . The capitan , Vincent de Saint - Castin , the commander at Pentagoet , married Marie Pidikiwamiska , the daughter of an Abenakis chief . </P> <P> In 1674 , the Dutch briefly conquered Acadia , renaming the colony New Holland . </P> <P> During the last decades of the seventeenth century , Acadians migrated from the capital , Port Royal , and established what would become the other major Acadian settlements before the Expulsion of the Acadians : Grand Pré , Chignecto , Cobequid and Pisiguit . Although not common , on occasion epidemics ravished the population of Ile St. - Jean , Ile Royale and Acadia . In 1732 / 33 more than 150 people died of smallpox on Ile Royale . </P> <P> The history of the settlers of Ile St. - Jean prior to the expulsion includes extreme hardship . For almost every good harvest year it seems that there was one in which crops failed . In one or two instances widespread fires destroyed crops , livestock and farms . Famine and starvation were common and frequently occasioned desperate pleas for supplies from Louisbourg , Québec and even France itself . In 1756 , famine on Ile St. - Jean prompted authorities to relocate some families to Québec . </P> <P> Prior to the founding of Halifax ( 1749 ) , Port Royal / Annapolis Royal was the capital of Acadia and later Nova Scotia for most of the previous 150 years . During that time the British made six attempts to conquer Acadia by defeating the capital . They finally defeated the French in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1710 ) . Over the following fifty years , the French and their allies made six unsuccessful military attempts to regain the capital . </P> <H2> Colonial wars ( edit ) </H2> Acadians at Annapolis Royal by Samuel Scott , 1751 ; earliest known image of Acadians Main article : Military history of the Acadians <P> There was already a long history of Acadian and Wabanaki Confederacy resistance to the British occupation of Acadia during the four French and Indian Wars and two local wars ( Father Rale 's War and Father Le Loutre 's War ) before the Expulsion of the Acadians . The Mi'kmaq and the Acadians were allies through Catholicism and through numerous inter-marriages . The Mi'kmaq held the military strength in Acadia even after the conquest of 1710 . They primarily resisted the British occupation of Acadia and were joined in their efforts on numerous occasions by Acadians . </P> <P> While many Acadians traded with the New England Protestants , Acadians ' participation in the wars clearly indicated that many were reluctant to be ruled by the British . During the first colonial war , King William 's War ( 1688 -- 97 ) , the crews of the very successful French privateer Pierre Maisonnat dit Baptiste were primarily Acadian . The Acadians resisted during the Raid on Chignecto ( 1696 ) . During Queen Anne 's War , Mi'kmaq and Acadians resisted during the Raid on Grand Pré , Piziquid and Chignecto in 1704 . The Acadians also assisted the French in protecting the capital in the Siege of Port Royal ( 1707 ) and the final Conquest of Acadia . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq were also successful in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) . </P> Acadians by Samuel Scott , Annapolis Royal , 1751 <P> During Father Rale 's War , the Maliseet raided numerous vessels on the Bay of Fundy while the Mi'kmaq engaged in the Raid on Canso , Nova Scotia ( 1723 ) . In the latter engagement , the Mi'kmaq were aided by Acadians . During King George 's War , Abbe Jean - Louis Le Loutre led many efforts which involved both Acadians and Mi'kmaq to recapture the capital such as the Siege of Annapolis Royal ( 1744 ) . During this siege , French officer Marin had taken British prisoners and stopped with them further up the bay at Cobequid . While at Cobequid , an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have `` left their ( the English ) carcasses behind and brought their skins '' . Le Loutre was also joined by prominent Acadian resistance leader Joseph Broussard ( Beausoleil ) . Broussard and other Acadians were involved in supporting the French soldiers in the Battle of Grand Pré . </P> <P> During Father Le Loutre 's War , the conflict continued . The Mi'kmaq attacked New England Rangers in the Siege of Grand Pré and Battle at St. Croix . Upon the founding of Dartmouth , Nova Scotia , Broussard and the Mi'kmaq conducted numerous raids on the village , such as the Raid on Dartmouth ( 1751 ) , to try to stop the Protestant migration into Nova Scotia . ( Similarly , during the French and Indian War , Mi'kmaq , Acadians and Maliseet also engaged in numerous raids on Lunenburg , Nova Scotia , to stop the migration , such as the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . ) Le Loutre and Broussard also worked together to resist the British occupation of Chignecto ( 1750 ) and then later they fought together with Acadians in the Battle of Beausejour ( 1755 ) . ( As early as the summer of 1751 , La Valiere reported , approximately 250 Acadians had already enrolled in the local militia at Fort Beausejour . ) </P> <P> When Charles Lawrence took over the post following Hopson 's return to England , he took a stronger stance . He was not only a government official but a military leader for the region . Lawrence came up with a military solution for the forty - five years of an unsettled British conquest of Acadia . The French and Indian War ( and Seven Years ' War in Europe ) began in 1754 . Lawrence 's primary objectives in Acadia were to defeat the French fortifications at Beausejour and Louisbourg . The British saw many Acadians as a military threat in their allegiance to the French and Mi'kmaq . The British also wanted to interrupt the Acadian supply lines to Fortress Louisbourg , which , in turn , supplied the Mi'kmaq . </P> <H3> French and Indian War ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Great Upheaval St. John River Campaign : Raid on Grimrose ( present day Gagetown , New Brunswick ) . This is the only contemporaneous image of the Expulsion of the Acadians . <P> The British Conquest of Acadia happened in 1710 . Over the next forty - five years the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain . During this time period Acadians participated in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour . During the French and Indian War , the British sought to neutralize any military threat Acadians posed and to interrupt the vital supply lines Acadians provided to Louisbourg by deporting Acadians from Acadia . </P> <P> Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better , while other Acadians did not sign because they were clearly anti-British . For the Acadians who might have signed an unconditional oath , there were numerous reasons why they did not . The difficulty was partly religious , in that the British monarch was the head of the ( Protestant ) Church of England . Another significant issue was that an oath might commit male Acadians to fight against France during wartime . A related concern was whether their Mi'kmaq neighbours might perceive this as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than the Mi'kmaq . As a result , signing an unconditional oath might have put Acadian villages in danger of attack from Mi'kmaq . </P> <P> In the Grand Dérangement ( the Great Upheaval ) , more than 12,000 Acadians ( three - fourths of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia ) were expelled from the colony between 1755 and 1764 . The British destroyed around 6,000 Acadian houses and dispersed the Acadians among the 13 colonies from Massachusetts to Georgia . The single event that involved the most deaths of Acadians was the sinking of the Duke William . Although there were no purposeful attempts to separate families , this did occur in the chaos of the eviction . </P> Siege of Louisbourg ( 1758 ) Acadian and Mi'kmaq resistance ( edit ) Marquis de Boishébert - Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot ( 1753 ) <P> With the Expulsion of the Acadians during the French and Indian War , the Mi'kmaq and Acadian resistance intensified . After the Expulsion began , much of the resistance was led by Charles Deschamps de Boishébert et de Raffetot . The Acadians and Mi'kmaq again engaged victoriously in the Battle of Petitcodiac ( 1755 ) and the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1757 ) . Acadians who were being deported from Annapolis Royal , Nova Scotia , on the ship Pembroke defeated the British crew and sailed to land . There was also resistance during the St. John River Campaign . Boishebert also ordered the Raid on Lunenburg ( 1756 ) . In the spring of 1756 , a wood - gathering party from Fort Monckton ( former Fort Gaspareaux ) , was ambushed and nine of them were scalped . </P> <P> In the April 1757 , a band of Acadian and Mi'kmaq raided a warehouse near Fort Edward , killing thirteen British soldiers and , after taking what provisions they could carry , setting fire to the building . A few days later , the same partisans also raided Fort Cumberland . </P> <P> Some Acadians escaped into the woods and lived with the Mi'kmaq ; some bands of partisans fought the British , including a group led by Joseph Broussard , known as `` Beausoleil '' , along the Petitcodiac River of New Brunswick . Some followed the coast northward , facing famine and disease . Some were recaptured , facing deportation or imprisonment at Fort Beausejour ( renamed Fort Cumberland ) until 1763 . </P> <P> Some Acadians became indentured servants in the British colonies . Massachusetts passed a law in November 1755 placing the Acadians under the custody of `` justices of the peace and overseers of the poor '' ; Pennsylvania , Maryland , and Connecticut adopted similar laws . The Province of Virginia under Robert Dinwiddie initially agreed to resettle about one thousand Acadians who arrived in the colony but later ordered most deported to England , writing that the `` French people '' were `` intestine enemies '' that were `` murdering and scalping our frontier Settlers '' . </P> <P> In 1758 , after the fall of Louisbourg , over 3,000 Acadians were deported to northern France . Resettlement attempts were tried in Châtellerault , Nantes , and Belle Île off Brittany . The French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon near Newfoundland became a safe harbor for many Acadian families until they were once again deported by the British in 1778 and 1793 . </P> <H3> Re-establishing in Nova Scotia ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the end of the Seven Years ' War in 1763 , Acadians were allowed to return to Nova Scotia as long as they did not settle in any one area in large numbers ; they were not permitted to resettle in the areas of Port Royal or Grand - Pré . Some Acadians resettled along the Nova Scotia coast and remain scattered across Nova Scotia to this day . Many dispersed Acadians looked for other homes . Beginning in 1764 , groups of Acadians began to arrive in Louisiana ( which had passed to Spanish control in 1762 ) . They eventually became known as Cajuns . </P> <P> Beginning in the 1770s , many Acadians were encouraged to return through the policies of Nova Scotia Governor Michael Francklin , who guaranteed Catholic worship , land grants and issued a promise that there would be no second expulsion ( At this time , Nova Scotia included present - day New Brunswick ) . However the fertile Acadian dykelands had been resettled by New England Planters , who were soon followed by Loyalists who further occupied former Acadian lands . Returning Acadians and those families who had escaped expulsion had to settle in other parts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick , in most cases isolated and infertile lands . The new Acadian settlements were forced to focus more on fishery and later forestry . </P> <P> Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included : </P> <Ul> <Li> 1767 St. Pierre et Miquelon </Li> <Li> 1772 census </Li> <Li> 1774 Founding of Saint - Anne 's church ; the Acadian school at Rustico and the abby Jean - Louis Beaubien ; the Trappistines in Tracadie </Li> <Li> 1785 Displacement from Fort Sainte - Anne to the upper Saint John River valley ( Madawaska ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Nineteenth century ( edit ) </H2> <P> Milestones of Acadian return and resettlement included : </P> <Ul> <Li> Jean - Mandé Sigogne ( 6 April 1763 -- 9 November 1844 ) was a French Catholic priest , who moved to Canada after the Revolution and became known for his missionary work among the Acadians of Nova Scotia . </Li> <Li> 1836 Simon d'Entremont and Frédéric Robichaud , MLAs in N.S. </Li> <Li> 1846 Amand Landry , MLA in N.B. </Li> <Li> 1847 , Longfellow publishes Evangeline </Li> <Li> 1854 , Stanislaw - Francois Poirier , MLA in P.E.I </Li> <Li> 1854 , the seminary Saint - Thomas in Memramcook , New Brunswick , becomes the first upper - level school for Acadians </Li> <Li> 1859 , the first history of Acadia is published in French by Edme Rameau de Saint - Père ; Acadians begin to become aware of their own existence </Li> </Ul> <H3> Acadian Renaissance ( edit ) </H3> Le Moniteur Acadien - first Acadian newspaper ( 1867 ) <Ul> <Li> 1864 founding of the Farmers ' Bank of Rustico , the earliest known community bank in Canada , under the leadership of Rev.

First elected to the legislature in 1952 , he became provincial Liberal leader in 1958 and led his party to victory in 1960 , 1963 , and 1967 . </P> <P> Robichaud modernized the province 's hospitals and public schools and introduced a wide range of reforms in an era that became known as the quiet revolution . To carry out these reforms , Robichaud restructured the municipal tax regime , expanded the government and sought to ensure that the quality of health care , education and social services was the same across the province -- a programme he called equal opportunity , is still a buzzword in New Brunswick . </P> <P> Critics accused of Robichaud 's government of `` robbing Peter to pay Pierre '' with the assumption being that rich municipalities were Anglophone ones and poor municipalities were Francophone ones . While it was true that the wealthier municipalities were predominantly in certain English - speaking areas , areas with significantly inferior services were to be found across the province in all municipalities . </P> <P> Robichaud was instrumental in the formation of New Brunswick 's only French - speaking university , the Université de Moncton , in 1963 , which serves the Acadian population of the Maritime provinces . </P> <P> His government also passed an act in 1969 making New Brunswick officially bilingual . `` Language rights '' , he said when he introduced the legislation , `` are more than legal rights . They are precious cultural rights , going deep into the revered past and touching the historic traditions of all our people .

Maillet received a BA and MA from the Université de Moncton , followed by a Ph. D. in literature in 1970 from the Université Laval . Maillet won the 1972 Governor General 's Award for Fiction for Don l'Orignal . In 1979 , Maillet published Pélagie - la - Charrette , for which she won the prix Goncourt . Maillet 's character `` La Sagouine '' ( from her book of the same name ) is the inspiration for `` Le Pays de la Sagouine '' in her hometown of Bouctouche . </P> <H2> Twenty - first century ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2003 , at the request of Acadian representatives , a proclamation was issued in the name of Queen Elizabeth II , acting as the Canadian monarch , officially acknowledging the deportation and establishing July 28 as a day of commemoration . The day of commemoration is observed by the Government of Canada , as the successor of the British Government . </P> <H3> Acadian remembrance day ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Fédération des Associations de Familles Acadiennnes of New Brunswick and the Société Saint - Thomas d'Aquin of Prince Edward Island has resolved that December 13 each year shall be commemorated as `` Acadian Remembrance Day '' in remembrance of all Acadians who died as a result of the deportation . The date December 13 was chosen to commemorate the sinking of the Duke William and the nearly 2000 Acadians deported from Île - Saint Jean who perished in the North Atlantic from hunger , disease and drowning in 1758 . The event has been commemorated annually since 2004 and participants mark the event by wearing a black star . </P> <H3> Acadian World Congress ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beginning in 1994 , the Acadian community gathered for an Acadian World Congress in New Brunswick . The congress has been held every 5 years since then : in Louisiana in 1999 , in Nova Scotia in 2004 , in the Acadian Peninsula of New Brunswick in 2009 . The 5th Acadian World Congress was hosted in 2014 by a gathering of 40 different communities located in three different provinces and different states in two countries . Northwestern New Brunswick and Témiscouata , Quebec , in Canada as well as Northern Maine in the United States joined hands to host the 5th CMA . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ For information of métis Acadians see : John Parmenter and Mark Power Robison .
